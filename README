This is the project that was made
by Dylan Sawyer and Phil Soga for
UPEI's Video Game Programming
Specialisation. It was built with
the help and guidance of industry
mentors.

All graphics were taken from RPG
Maker VX and various online
databases.

This is not a commercial product.
It was created for educational
purposes.
